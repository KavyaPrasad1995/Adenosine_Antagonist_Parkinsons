# A2A-D2 Receptor Interaction in Dopaminergic Pathways: PET Imaging Analysis

## Introduction
This project investigates the modulation of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) availability by adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonism and its effects on neuroinflammation in a preclinical model using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.
The study specifically explores:

D2 receptor occupancy changes using the [11C]raclopride PET tracer.
Neuroinflammatory response using [11C]PBR28 PET imaging, which targets translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of microglial activation.
Effects of chronic A2A receptor blockade (KW6002) on neuroinflammation and dopaminergic signaling.
## Methods & Data Analysis
This project involves longitudinal PET imaging in a preclinical model using the following workflow:
### Animal Model & Imaging Protocol
Species: Wistar rats (n=32).
Experimental Groups:
Vehicle-treated control
KW6002 (A2A antagonist) 3 mg/kg for 7 or 20 days
### PET Imaging:
[11C]raclopride PET for D2 receptor availability.
[11C]PBR28 PET for neuroinflammation assessment.
Immunohistochemistry: Iba1 staining to validate microglial activation levels.
## Data Processing & Statistical Analysis
### Time-Activity Curves (TACs): Extracted for striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc).
### Binding Potential (BPND) Analysis:
Simplified Reference Tissue Model (SRTM2) for [11C]raclopride.
SUV ratio (Ipsi/Contra) for [11C]PBR28 uptake.
### Statistical Methods:
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) for longitudinal PET data.
Two-way ANOVA for group comparisons.
Effect size estimation (Cohen’s d)
## Key Findings
### Chronic KW6002 treatment significantly reduced D2R availability (measured by [11C]raclopride BPND) in both hemispheres of the striatum.
### KW6002 suppressed neuroinflammation, reducing Iba1+ microglial density in the caudate-putamen and NAc.
### PET findings were confirmed by histology, with lower microglial activation (Iba1 staining) in KW6002-treated animals.

Effect of KW6002 on motor function, evaluated with the rotarod test, using the outcome parameters (a) ‘Latency to fall’, (b) ‘Distance travelled’  and (c) ‘Acceleration’, and with the cylinder test, using the outcome parameter (d) asymmetric forelimb use. Statistically significant differences between vehicle (n=7) and KW6002 treated rats (n=8) are indicated as *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Significant differences between timepoints within groups are indicated as ## p<0.01 , ### p<0.001 and ####p<0.0001.*
